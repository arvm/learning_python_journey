GOALS:
- Add tasks
- View tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Save/load tasks from a file

Stage 1:
-  Show a main menu: `[1] Add Task [2] View Tasks [3] Exit`
-  Let the user type in a task name and store it in memory
-  Print all tasks (e.g., numbered list)
-  Loop the menu until the user chooses to exit

Stage 2:
-  Save tasks to a `.txt` or `.json` file
-  Load tasks when the program starts
-  Handle errors (e.g., no file exists yet)

Stage 3:
-  Let user **mark a task as done**
-  Add the ability to **delete a task** by number
-  Maybe add a status symbol (`✅` / `❌`)
