My journey to learn python
# 🚀 Learning Python by Building — No More Tutorials!

Welcome! 👋

This repository is a personal journey — my decision to **ditch tutorials** and start learning Python **by building real projects**.

## 🧠 Why I Ditched Tutorials

After a lot of time spent jumping from one tutorial to the next, I realized something:  
> I was *watching* people code more than I was coding myself.

Even though I had some basic Python knowledge, I wasn’t growing the way I wanted. I wasn’t solving problems. I wasn’t proud of my work.  
So I decided to change that.

### 💡 The New Plan

Instead of watching more content, I'm focusing on **building projects**, guided by challenges and advice from [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) — acting like my personal mentor. Every project I create here is designed to:
- Challenge me
- Teach me something new
- Move me closer to real-world skills companies care about

This repo will grow over time as I build up from beginner-friendly projects to more advanced, job-ready apps.

## 📁 What's Inside

Each folder in this repo is a project, complete with:
- 💻 Source code
- 📝 Project notes (lessons, bugs, things I had to Google)
- 🚧 To-do features
- 💬 Comments from ChatGPT if we collaborated on design or logic

## 🌱 Projects (So Far)

| # | Project | Description | Status |
|---|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `todo-cli-app` | A simple CLI to-do list manager with file saving | 🚧In Progress |

*(This list will grow—check back for updates!)*

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I'm Sharing This

Because I know I’m not alone.  
If you’ve ever felt stuck in the tutorial loop or unsure how to **really level up**, maybe this repo can help. Or inspire you to start your own journey.

You're welcome to follow along, fork, contribute ideas, or share your own path!
